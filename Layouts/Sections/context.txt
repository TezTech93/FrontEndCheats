In web and app development, layouts are essential for organizing content and ensuring a seamless user experience. Here are the most common types of layouts:

---

### **1. Static Layout (Fixed Layout)**

### **2. Fluid Layout (Liquid Layout)**
- **Description**: The layout uses percentages for widths, allowing content to resize relative to the screen size.
- **Use Case**: Provides better adaptability across devices compared to static layouts.
- **Pros**: More flexible than static layouts.
- **Cons**: Can lead to awkward spacing or readability issues on extreme screen sizes.
